GSI :-
Updates to GSI are not supported as explained in the docs:

Updates are not supported. The following are exceptions:
If you update only the provisioned throughput values of global secondary indexes, you can update the table without interruption.
You can delete or add one global secondary index without interruption. If you do both in the same update (for example, by changing the index's logical ID), the update fails.

- Always add GSI PK and SK -> You can't modify the existing key in GSI
